Docker support is provided 'as-is'
It provides a image that should contain anything required to compile/run/debug Nachos.
It does NOT contains the Nachos source code.

The easiest way to use it is to run it with the provided 'runit' script
using the public image 'vdanjean/nachos' by running something like:
$ ...path-to.../runit

You should get a shell inside the docker image, running as your current user,
with your home available and not changing the current working directory.
